This example demonstrates how to run minGMIN using python style scripts,
completely bypassing data files and keywords.  A simple Lennard-Jones potential
is used.  By default the fast cpp implimentation of LJ is used which must be
compliled, but you can use the slow python implimentation by recommenting which
potential is imported

In order to run, python must know how to find the modules it imports (e.g.
basinhopping.py). To this end you must add the directory which holds
basinhopping.py to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

PYTHONPATH="mydirectory:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH

The above commands can be added to your .bashrc file.


finall, run

python ljscript.py
