First quick and dirty test of a gui. So far only the minima of a Basin Hopping 
run can be viewed. Planned features are continue / pause run in background
and start NEB runs using the gui. 

I decided for qt since it has a very nice API and gui designer. 
The file MainWindow.py is automatically generated using the command

  pyuic4 MainWindow.ui -o MainWidow.py

I will add this to the build script later. To edit the gui use

  designer-qt4 MainWindow.ui

As far as I remember correctly, the following packages are required (on Fedora):
- for running the gui: PyQt4, PyOpenGl
- for development (contains the qt designer): PyQt4-devel
