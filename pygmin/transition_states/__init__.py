Transition States
=================
this module contains functions and classes related to local transition state searches.
Most of these algorithms will not need to be directly called by the user.  However
it is important to know how these work because they form some of the core routines of
:ref:`landscape exploration <landscape_module>`.

Orthogonalize to zero eigenvectors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These functions make a vector orthogonal to known zero eigenvectors (eigenvectors with a zero eigenvalue).  Typically these
correspond to known symmetries of the system like translational invariance, rotational invariance.
Frozen degrees of freedom also contribute zero eigenvecotrs

    gramm_schmidt

Finding minima on either side of a transition state
---------------------------------------------------
When a transition state is found we step off either side of the transition state to find
the minima which the transition state connects.  This routine controls that process
