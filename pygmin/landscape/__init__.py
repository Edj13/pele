This module implements routines for exploring the energy landscape.  This
primarily consists of double ended transition state searches

Double ended transition state search
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Double ended transition state searches are the main technique we use
for exploring the energy landscape.  We attempt to try to find a connected
series of transition states between two minima.
