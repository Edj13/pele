Landscape Exploration
=====================

This module implements routines for exploring the energy landscape.  This
primarily consists of using DoubleEndedConnect to find connected pathways
of minimum -> transition state -> minimum between two minima.

Double ended transition state search
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Double ended transition state searches are the main technique we use
for exploring the energy landscape.  We attempt to try to find a connected
series of minima and transition states between two end point minima.
