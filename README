minGMIN, a minimal version of GMIN, originally written by David Wales.  Desiged
to find the global energy minimum for molecular systems

the input files are
data
coords

to compile (only if you're using the fast potentials.  Uses f2py, which is part of the numpy package.)
make

run the program with
python mingmin.py


The lowest energy structure found will be in file 
lowest

Currently all unique quenched structures found are printed to file
dump.q.xyz

To use the C++ potentials:
You need to have boost-python, boost-dev and python-dev installed
cd cpp
cmake .
make
cp ljcpp_.so ..
cd ..

Then use ljcpp in data file. So far no parameters can be added.
