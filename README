PyGMIN, a python version of GMIN, OPTIM, and PATHSAMPLE.  GMIN was originally
written by David Wales and is desiged to find the global energy minimum for
molecular systems.

The code project upon which this python package is based can be found at

INSTALLATION
============

Required packages
-----------------

for compilation::
  cython
  f2py (comes bundled with numpy, see below)

python packages::

  numpy (with f2py)
  scipy
  networkx
     https://networkx.lanl.gov
     for graph functionality
  SQLAlchemy 0.7 
     http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
     for managing database of stationary points 


  hungarian (optional, use pip/easy_install to get newest version with bugfixes!)
     for min dist routines
     
All packages can be installed via the python package managers pip or easy_install.
However, some of the packages (numpy, scipy) have additional dependencies and it
can be more convenient to use the linux package manager (apt, yum, ...).

If you want to use the gui you need:
  matplotlib 
  qt4 python bindings
  opengl python bindings

The Ubuntu packages are (apt-get or aptitude)::

  python-qt4
  python-opengl 
  python-qt4-gl

  pymol (optional)

Or Fedora (yum)::
   PyQt4
   PyOpenGl

Compilation
-----------

Compilation is required for use of the fast potentials, those written in C++
and/or fortran).  The package uses the standard python setup utility
(distutils).  There are lots of options for how and where to install. For more
information::
  
  python setup.py --help 
  python setup.py --help-commands

Developers probably want to install "in-place", i.e. build the extension
modules in their current directories::

  python setup.py build_ext -i

Users can install pygmin in the standard python package location::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install [--user]

where --user installs it in $HOME/.local/


PYTHONPATH  
----------
make sure to add the install directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable
