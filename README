PyGMIN, a python version of GMIN, OPTIM, and PATHSAMPLE.  GMIN was originally
written by David Wales and is desiged to find the global energy minimum for
molecular systems.

The code project upon which this python package is based can be found at

INSTALLATION
============

Required packages
-----------------

for compilation::
  cython
  f2py (comes bundled with numpy, see below)

python packages (install using easy_install or pip)::

  numpy (with f2py)
  scipy
  networkx
     https://networkx.lanl.gov
     for graph functionality
  SQLAlchemy 0.7 
     http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
     for managing database of stationary points 


  hungarian (optional)
     for min dist routines
     

If you want to use the gui you need python bindings for qt4 and opengl.  The
following packages install what you need for ubuntu (using the repository
managager apt-get or aptitude)::

  python-qt4
  python-opengl 
  python-qt4-gl

  pymol (optional)


If you want to use the gui you also need the python package::

  matplotlib





Compilation
-----------

Compilation is required for use of the fast potentials, those written in C++
and/or fortran).  The package uses the standard python setup utility
(distutils).  There are lots of options for how and where to install. For more
information::
  
  python setup.py --help 
  python setup.py --help-commands

Developers probably want to install "in-place", i.e. build the extension
modules in their current directories::

  python setup.py build_ext -i

Users can install pygmin in the standard python package location::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install [--user]

where --user installs it in $HOME/.local/


PYTHONPATH  
----------
make sure to add the install directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable
