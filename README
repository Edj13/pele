PyGMIN, a python version of GMIN, OPTIM, and PATHSAMPLE.  GMIN was originally
written by David Wales and is desiged to find the global energy minimum for
molecular systems.

The code project upon which this python package is based can be found at
http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/software.html

The code is hosted at

INSTALLATION
============

Required packages
-----------------

for compilation::
  cython
  f2py (comes bundled with numpy, see below)

python packages::

  numpy (with f2py)
  scipy
  networkx
     https://networkx.lanl.gov
     for graph functionality
  SQLAlchemy 0.7 
     http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
     for managing database of stationary points 


  hungarian (optional, use pip/easy_install to get newest version with bugfixes!)
     for min dist routines
     
All the above packages can be installed via the python package managers pip or easy_install.
However, some of the packages (numpy, scipy) have additional dependencies and it
can be more convenient to use the linux package manager (apt, yum, ...).

If you want to use the gui you need:
  matplotlib 
  qt4 python bindings
  opengl python bindings

The Ubuntu packages are (apt-get)::

  python-qt4
  python-opengl 
  python-qt4-gl

  pymol (optional)

Or Fedora (yum)::
   PyQt4
   PyOpenGl


Prerequisits on Ubuntu
----------------------
if you're running ubuntu, you can get all the prerequisits with the following commands

$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-qt4 python-opengl python-qt4-gl python-pip
$ pip install --user networkx sqlalchemy hungarian
(in the above, the flag --user will install localy.)


Compilation
-----------

Compilation is required for use of the fast potentials, those written in C++
and/or fortran).  The package uses the standard python setup utility
(distutils).  There are lots of options for how and where to install. For more
information::
  
  python setup.py --help 
  python setup.py --help-commands

Developers probably want to install "in-place", i.e. build the extension
modules in their current directories::

  python setup.py build_ext -i

Users can install pygmin in the standard python package location::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install [--user]

where --user installs it in $HOME/.local/


PYTHONPATH  
----------
make sure to add the install directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable


Installing on Mac
-----------------
When I used macports, everything installed very easily.  However, at least on my machine
the OpenGL / Qt implementation was broken and I could never get it to work.  So I aborted
using macports and installed everything by hand.  I eventually got (almost) everything working.
Here are a few hints

use the Enthought python distribution instead of the prepackaged one.  This seems to be standard, plus
it includes numpy and scipy http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php

if you want to use the gui you have to install pyqt and its dependencies.  This is not as simple as
it should be.  I roughly followed the instructions here http://www.noktec.be/python/how-to-install-pyqt4-on-osx
Even though my mac is 64 bit I had to compile things with --arch=i386.  I think I even had to install Qt from source
to get it with the 32 bit architechture.    Also, when compiling pyqt, you have to point to the qmake in the Qt install folder, not /usr/bin/qmake
as the website says.  Sorry for the vague instructions, I'm writing this from memory.  If you have more complete installation help please
email or submit a pull request.

Installing pymol was easy with macports, but since I've abandoned macports 
I haven't gotten it installed and running (I haven't tried the pay version)
